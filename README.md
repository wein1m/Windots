<summary><b>The backstory🐇</b></summary>
  
My personal Windows-friendly dotfiles.    
Originally made just as a backup in case I randomly decide to wipe my Windows for no reason(yes.. i've done that twice🫥), but after seeing many cool Linux rices, I figured, how about me making a windows rice instead? it might be useful for others too. Even though most people would probably just switch to Linux instead.  
  
Right now, there's no auto-installation scripts or setup tools. Everything is configured manually, but I might add something like that in the future.  
  
The part I like the most in this repo is the PowerShell Core `$PROFILE`, which contains most of my aliases, functions, and general configurations that make my daily workflow much easier.
